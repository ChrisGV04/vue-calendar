# CGV WEB - Vue Calendar

A set of reusable composables for Vue 3 that give you the building blocks to build your own interactive calendar component. Heavily inspired by [`radix-vue`](https://www.radix-vue.com).

These composables are developed by [Christian Gil](https://cgvweb.com) mainly to be used at my own freelance projects.

## Features

- Headless. Build your own UI
- Uses [`@internationalized/date`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html)
- Fully typed

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install -D @cgvweb/vue-calendar
```
